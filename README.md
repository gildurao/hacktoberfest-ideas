Your ideas are worth sharing and the world needs to hear them!

## How can I share my idea?
Simply fork the repo and run one of the scripts to share your idea!

You can also edit both [Ideas](ideas.md) and [README](README.md) documents if you don't feel like a scripty day.

## Do I need to provide extra information regarding my idea?
No, but you can also categorize it and mark the author/s who came up with the idea.

## Are all ideas accepted?
Yes! As stated before your idea is worth sharing and more than accepted even if it requires an evil scientist to put it in action!

For obvious reasons any racism involved is rejected.

## Regarding the scripts, what do I need to do to run them?
For any available script you only need to run it and passing the arguments for it.

The available arguments are displayed above:

|Argument|Description|Required|
|--------|-----------|--------|
|# 1|Provides your idea description|Yes|
|# 2|Provides the category your idea belongs|No|
|# 3|Provides the author/s who came up with the idea|No|

## Note to wholesome persons who share their ideas

The current process to accept pull requests is by manually reviewing them and accepting them, so don't panic if its not accepted immediately!
